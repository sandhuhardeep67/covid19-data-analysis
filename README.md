COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
Description: This repository houses my inaugural data analysis project, undertaken with great enthusiasm and ambition as an aspiring Data Analyst. After extensive research, I chose to work with the accurate and comprehensive COVID-19 dataset from Our World in Data, addressing the global pandemic that profoundly impacted every facet of life.

Project Overview
Initial Steps: The journey began with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL in SSMS. Rigorous data cleaning was performed, removing unwanted data to free up space and converting blank values to null to enhance data consistency and accuracy while reducing storage overhead.

Data Insights Extraction: Utilizing SQL queries like Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, and views, I derived crucial insights from the dataset. The analysis focused on global infection rates, total deaths, and vaccination statistics.

Dashboard Creation: Leveraging Power BI, I created intuitive and impactful dashboards to visualize the data, providing clear insights at a glance.

Key Features
Thorough Data Cleaning: Effective management of raw data, including handling null values and unnecessary data.

Insightful SQL Queries: Advanced SQL techniques to extract meaningful information from the dataset.

Visual Dashboards: Power BI dashboards offering powerful and simple insights to help understand the data better.

Technologies Used
SQL (SSMS): For data cleaning and analysis

Power BI: For creating dashboards

Python & Excel: Additional tools for data manipulation and visualization
