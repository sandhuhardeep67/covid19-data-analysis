# covid19-data-analysis
This repository contains my first-ever data analysis project, centered on the COVID-19 dataset sourced from Our World in Data. The project involved rigorous data cleaning processes, including handling blank values, converting them to nulls, and removing unnecessary data to create a clean and useful dataset for analysis.
